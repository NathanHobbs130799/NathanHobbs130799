- 👋 Hi, I’m @NathanHobbs130799
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding to start a career, I'm 24 and have worked in hospitality management for the past 3/4 years. After doing my own research IT and coding seemed very interesting to me so I've decided to start my journey in learning and hopefully get my foot in the door!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics lol. This is the start of my journey and have just started to learn HTML by making a cat photo app through some free coding courses, was super interesting and when I understood how HTML worked it was actually quite fun to create it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on absolutely anything that'll help develop my skills and knowledge. Ideally i'd love to find a mentor to guide me on the journey!
- 📫 How to reach me? you can reach me via email which is nathan.hobbs111@gmail.com
